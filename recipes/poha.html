    <div class="description"><p>Poha, also known as pohe, aval, pauwa, sira, chira, chivda, or avalakki, among many other names, is flattened rice originating from the Indian subcontinent. Rice is parboiled before flattening so that it can be consumed with very little to no cooking. These flakes of rice swell when added to liquid, whether hot or cold, as they absorb water, milk or any other liquids. The thickness of the flakes varies from almost translucently thin (the more expensive varieties) to nearly four times thinner than a normal rice grain.</p>
    <p>This easily digestible form of raw rice is very popular across India, Nepal and Bangladesh, and is normally used to prepare snacks or light and easy fast food in a variety of Indian cuisine styles, some even for long-term consumption of a week or more.</p>

            <li>Step 1 Wash and chop veggies
                To begin with, wash the veggies, chop them and keep them aside. In the meantime, take a poha on a strainer and clean it with some water or else soak it for 5 minutes, drain the water and keep it aside.</li><br>
